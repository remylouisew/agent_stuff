        "\n",
        "2.The Specialists üßë‚Äçüî¨: The system assigns each task to the right specialist. An agent_search handles general web research, while an agent_arxiv dives into academic papers to find scholarly sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.The Synthesizer ‚úçÔ∏è: As the specialists complete their tasks, their findings are gathered. A final agent then synthesizes all this information into a single, well-structured newsletter.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.The Critic ü§î: To enable learning and improvement, a Critic agent reviews the entire process‚Äîfrom the initial plan to the final output‚Äîand provides feedback on how the system can perform better next time.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you'll see a complete, end-to-end simulation of an autonomous system that can plan, execute, synthesize, and reflect to accomplish a creative task."

            "    *   **Summary**: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models (LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings. Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical workloads involve long contexts. This paper finds current approaches degrade severely with long contexts, with some even slowing down generation speed. It addresses these limitations by releasing a new long-context benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in the verifier that produces richer repr.\n",

            "    *   **Summary**: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. This work investigates the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of \"thinking while listening,\" the paper proposes methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to think while listening.\n",

Together, these contributions form a unified framework combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic planning to comprehensively evaluate LLMs.\n",

This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think, which is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction. This paper addresses this by noting that humans naturally \"think while listening.\" It proposes SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning.\n",

This work presents a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. It proves theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establishes bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), the paper confirms that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate the theoretical predictions.\n",

            "*   **Clear & Actionable Prompts:** The prompts generated for each agent are specific and effective. For example, \"Find a highly-cited survey paper\" for `agent_arxiv` is much better than a vague \"find papers.\" Similarly, asking `agent_search` for \"recent (last 1-2 years) high-profile examples\" provides a clear temporal constraint.\n",

            "*   **Inappropriate Agent for Synthesis:** The final step, `agent_search, Summarize the overall findings...`, is a significant flaw in the plan's logic. **`agent_search` is a retrieval agent, not a synthesis or writer agent.** Its job is to find information, not to read, understand, integrate, and create a new, cohesive narrative in a \"witty format.\" This is like asking a librarian to not only find the books but also write the book report.

            "    *   A new agent, let's call it `agent_writer` or `agent_curator`, should be created. Its core capability would be to take multiple text inputs (the findings from the other agents) and a set of instructions (e.g., \"witty format,\" \"newsletter structure\") to generate the final artifact.\n",

            "3.  **Establish a Shared Memory/Context:**\n",
            "    *   Instead of each agent operating in a vacuum, the system should maintain a shared \"workspace\" or \"context object\" (e.g., a JSON object).\n",
            "    *   As each search agent completes its task, it doesn't just return a block of text; it populates a structured field in this workspace. For example:\n",
